        On a 110-degree day several years ago, surrounded by piles of sand and
        rock in the desert outside of Las Vegas, I stepped into a yellow cage
        large enough to fit three standing adults and was lowered 600 feet
        through a black hole into the ground. There, at the bottom, amid pooling
        water and dripping rock, was an enormous machine driving a cone-shaped
        drill bit into the earth. The machine was carving a cavernous, 3-mile
        tunnel beneath the bottom of the nation’s largest freshwater reservoir,
        Lake Mead.
      </p>
      <p>
        Lake Mead, a reservoir formed by the construction of the Hoover Dam in
        the 1930s, is one of the most important pieces of infrastructure on the
        Colorado River, supplying fresh water to Nevada, California, Arizona and
        Mexico. The reservoir hasn’t been full since 1983. In 2000, it began a
        steady decline caused by epochal drought. On my visit in 2015, the lake
        was just about 40% full. A chalky ring on the surrounding cliffs marked
        where the waterline once reached, like the residue on an empty bathtub.
        The tunnel far below represented Nevada’s latest salvo in a simmering
        water war: the construction of a $1.4 billion drainage hole to ensure
        that if the lake ever ran dry, Las Vegas could get the very last drop.
      </p>
      <p>
        For years, experts in the American West have predicted that, unless the
        steady overuse of water was brought under control, the Colorado River
        would no longer be able to support all of the 40 million people who
        depend on it. Over the past two decades, Western states took incremental
        steps to save water, signed agreements to share what was left and then,
        like Las Vegas, did what they could to protect themselves. But they
        believed the tipping point was still a long way off.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Colorado River’s enormous significance extends well beyond the
        American West. In addition to providing water for the people of seven
        states, 29 federally recognized tribes and northern Mexico, its water is
        used to grow everything from the carrots stacked on supermarket shelves
        in New Jersey to the beef in a hamburger served at a Massachusetts
        diner. The power generated by its two biggest dams — the Hoover and Glen
        Canyon — is marketed across an electricity grid that reaches from
        Arizona to Wyoming.
      </p>
      <p>
        The formal declaration of the water crisis arrived days after the Census
        Bureau released numbers showing that, even as the drought worsened over
        recent decades, hundreds of thousands more people have moved to the
        regions that depend on the Colorado.
      </p>
      <hr />
      <p>
        Phoenix expanded more over the past 10 years than any other large
        American city, while smaller urban areas across Arizona, Nevada, Utah
        and California each ranked among the fastest-growing places in the
        country. The river’s water supports roughly 15 million more people today
        than it did when Bill Clinton was elected president in 1992. These
        statistics suggest that the climate crisis and explosive development in
        the West are on a collision course. And it raises the question: What
        happens next?
      </p>
      <p>
        Since about 70% of water delivered from the Colorado River goes to
        growing crops, not to people in cities, the next step will likely be to
        demand large-scale reductions for farmers and ranchers across millions
        of acres of land, forcing wrenching choices about which crops to grow
        and for whom — an omen that many of America’s food-generating regions
        might ultimately have to shift someplace else as the climate warms.
      </p>
      <p>
        California, so far shielded from major cuts, has already agreed to
        reductions that will take effect if the drought worsens. But it may be
        asked to do more. Its enormous share of the river, which it uses to
        irrigate crops across the Imperial Valley and for Los Angeles and other
        cities, will be in the crosshairs when negotiations over a diminished
        Colorado begin again. The Imperial Irrigation District there is the
        largest single water rights holder from the entire basin and has been
        especially resistant to compromise over the river. It did not sign the
        drought contingency plan laying out cuts that other big players on the
        Colorado system agreed to in 2019.
      </p>
      <p>
        New Mexico, Colorado, Utah and Wyoming — states in the river’s Upper
        Basin — will most likely also face pressure to use less water. Should
        that happen, places like Utah that hoped to one day support faster
        development and economic growth with their share of the river may have
        to surrender their ambition.
      </p>
      <p>
        The negotiations that led to the region being even minimally prepared
        for this latest shortage were agonizing, but they were merely a warm-up
        for the pain-inflicting cuts and sacrifices that almost certainly will
        be required if the water shortages persist over the coming decades. The
        region’s leaders, for all their efforts to compromise, have long avoided
        these more difficult conversations. One way or another, farms will have
        to surrender their water, and cities will have to live with less of it.
        Time has run out for other options.
      </p>

        Western states arrived at this crucible in large part because of their
        own doing. The original multistate compact that governs the use of the
        Colorado, which was signed in 1922, was exuberantly optimistic: The
        states agreed to divide up an estimated total amount of water that
        turned out to be much more than what would actually flow. Nevertheless,
        with the building of the Hoover Dam to collect and store river water,
        and the development of the Colorado’s plumbing system of canals and
        pipelines to deliver it, the West was able to open a savings account to
        fund its extraordinary economic growth. Over the years since, those
        states have overdrawn the river’s average deposits. It should be no
        surprise that even without the pressures of climate change, such a plan
        would lead to bankruptcy.
      </p>
      <p>
        Making a bad situation worse, leaders in Western states have allowed
        wasteful practices to continue that add to the material threat facing
        the region. A majority of the water used by farms — and thus much of the
        river — goes to growing nonessential crops like alfalfa and other
        grasses that feed cattle for meat production. Much of those grasses are
        also exported to feed animals in the Middle East and Asia. Short of
        regulating which types of crops are allowed, which state authorities may
        not even have the authority to do, it may fall to consumers to drive
        change. Water usage data suggests that if Americans avoid meat one day
        each week they could save an amount of water equivalent to the entire
        flow of the Colorado each year, more than enough water to alleviate the
        region’s shortages.

        Water is also being wasted because of flaws in the laws. The rights to
        take water from the river are generally distributed — like deeds to
        property — based on seniority. It is very difficult to take rights away
        from existing stakeholders, whether cities or individual ranchers, so
        long as they use the water allocated to them. That system creates a
        perverse incentive: Across the basin, ranchers often take their maximum
        allocation each year, even if just to spill it on the ground, for fear
        that, if they don’t, they could lose the right to take that water in the
        future. Changes in the laws that remove the threat of penalties for not
        exercising water rights, or that expand rewards for ranchers who
        conserve water, could be an easy remedy.
      </p>
      <p>
        A breathtaking amount of the water from the Colorado — about 10% of the
        river’s recent total flow — simply evaporates off the sprawling surfaces
        of large reservoirs as they bake in the sun. Last year, evaporative
        losses from Lake Mead and Lake Powell alone added up to almost a million
        acre feet of water — or nearly twice what Arizona will be forced to give
        up now as a result of this month’s shortage declaration. These losses
        are increasing as the climate warms. Yet federal officials have so far
        discounted technological fixes — like covering the water surface to
        reduce the losses — and they continue to maintain both reservoirs, even
        though both of them are only around a third full. If the two were
        combined, some experts argue, much of those losses could be avoided.
      </p>

        For all the hard-won progress made at the negotiating table, it remains
        to be seen whether the stakeholders can tackle the looming challenges
        that come next. Over the years, Western states and tribes have agreed on
        voluntary cuts, which defused much of the political chaos that would
        otherwise have resulted from this month’s shortage declaration, but they
        remain disparate and self-interested parties hoping they can
        miraculously agree on a way to manage the river without truly changing
        their ways. For all their wishful thinking, climate science suggests
        there is no future in the region that does not include serious
        disruptions to its economy, growth trajectory and perhaps even quality
        of life.
      </p>
      <p>
        The uncomfortable truth is that difficult and unpopular decisions are
        now unavoidable. Prohibiting some water uses as unacceptable — long
        eschewed as antithetical to personal freedoms and the rules of
        capitalism — is now what’s needed most.
      </p>
      <p>
        The laws that determine who gets water in the West, and how much of it,
        are based on the principle of “beneficial use” — generally the idea that
        resources should further economic advancement. But whose economic
        advancement? Do we support the farmers in Arizona who grow alfalfa to
        feed cows in the United Arab Emirates? Or do we ensure the survival of
        the Colorado River, which supports some 8% of the nation’s GDP?
      </p>
      <p>
        Earlier this month, the Bureau of Reclamation released lesser-noticed
        projections for water levels, and they are sobering. The figures include
        an estimate for what the bureau calls “minimum probable in flow” — or
        the low end of expectations. Water levels in Lake Mead could drop by
        another 40 vertical feet by the middle 2023, ultimately reaching just
        1,026 feet above sea level — an elevation that further threatens Lake
        Mead’s hydroelectric power generation for about 1.3 million people in
        Arizona, California and Nevada. At 895 feet, the reservoir would become
        what’s called a “dead pool”; water would no longer be able to flow
        downstream.
      </p>
      <p>
        The bureau’s projections mean we are close to uncharted territory. The
        current shortage agreement, negotiated between the states in 2007, only
        addresses shortages down to a lake elevation of 1,025 feet. After that,
        the rules become murky, and there is greater potential for fraught legal
        conflicts. Northern states in the region, for example, are likely to ask
        why the vast evaporation losses from Lake Mead, which stores water for
        the southern states, have never been counted as a part of the water
        those southern states use. Fantastical and expensive solutions that have
        previously been dismissed by the federal government — like the
        desalinization of seawater, towing icebergs from the Arctic or pumping
        water from the Mississippi River through a pipeline — are likely to be
        seriously considered. None of this, however, will be enough to solve the
        problem unless it’s accompanied by serious efforts to lower carbon
        dioxide emissions, which are ultimately responsible for driving changes
        to the climate.
      </p>
      <p>
        Meanwhile, population growth in Arizona and elsewhere in the basin is
        likely to continue, at least for now, because short-term fixes so far
        have obscured the seriousness of the risks to the region. Water is still
        cheap, thanks to the federal subsidies for all those dams and canals
        that make it seem plentiful. The myth persists that technology can
        always outrun nature, that the American West holds endless possibility.
        It may be the region’s undoing. As the author Wallace Stegner once
        wrote: “One cannot be pessimistic about the West. This is the native
        home of hope.”
