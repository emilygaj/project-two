      <i>The Truth Behind the Manmade Water Crisis in the West</i>
    </h2>
    <p class="article">
      With the building of the Hoover Dam to collect and store river water, and
      the development of the Colorado’s plumbing system of canals and pipelines
      to deliver it, the West was able to open a savings account to fund its
      extraordinary economic growth.
    </p>
    <p class="article">
      Over the years since, those states have overdrawn the river’s average
      deposits. It should be no surprise that even without the pressures of
      climate change, such a plan would lead to bankruptcy.

        The original multistate compact that governs the use of the Colorado,
        which was signed in 1922, was exuberantly optimistic: The states agreed
        to divide up an estimated total amount of water that turned out to be
        much more than what would actually flow.
      </p>
      <p class="questions">
        <i><b>Q: What is the next step?</b></i>
      </p>
      <p>
        Since about 70% of water delivered from the Colorado River goes to
        growing crops, not to people in cities, the next step will likely be to
        demand large-scale reductions for farmers and ranchers across millions
        of acres of land, forcing wrenching choices about which crops to grow
        and for whom — an omen that many of America’s food-generating regions
        might ultimately have to shift someplace else as the climate warms.
      </p>
      <p class="questions">
        <i><b>Q: What can I do?</b></i>
      </p>
      <p id="lastfaq">
        Short of regulating which types of crops are allowed, which state
        authorities may not even have the authority to do, it may fall to
        consumers to drive change. Water usage data suggests that if Americans
        avoid meat one day each week they could save an amount of water
        equivalent to the entire flow of the Colorado each year, more than
        enough water to alleviate the region’s shortages.
